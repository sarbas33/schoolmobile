# Fixing Ionicons Not Showing in React Native

If you are encountering issues with Ionicons not displaying in your React Native project, follow the steps below to resolve the problem.

## Installation

Ensure that `react-native-vector-icons` is correctly installed in your project:

### Using npm:
```bash
npm install react-native-vector-icons --save
```

### Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn add react-native-vector-icons
```

## Configuration

### iOS Configuration

For iOS, you may need to manually link the fonts used by `react-native-vector-icons`. Add the following to your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'RNVectorIcons', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons'
```

Afterward, run:

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

### Android Configuration

For Android, ensure that the following line is included in your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
```

### Rebuild the Application

Once you've added the necessary configuration, you'll need to rebuild your application:

#### For Android:
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

#### For iOS:
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Clear Metro Bundler Cache

If issues persist, try clearing the Metro bundler cache and restarting the development server:

```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### Additional Tips

- **Reinstalling the App**: If the icons are still not showing up, try uninstalling the app from your device or emulator and then reinstalling it. This can help clear any cached issues.

- **Running on USB**: Some users have reported that running the app via USB instead of over Wi-Fi resolved their issues.

## Troubleshooting

If the problem persists after following the steps above, consider the following:

- Verify that you have correctly linked the font files in your project.
- Ensure there are no conflicts or overrides in your project that might be affecting the icons.
- Consider trying an alternative icon library or creating custom icons as images if necessary.

## Conclusion

Following these steps should resolve the issue with Ionicons not displaying in your React Native project. If you encounter further problems, consult the official documentation or reach out to the community for support.
